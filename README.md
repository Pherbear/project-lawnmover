Description:
For our project, we created two different algorithms for sorting disks in our disk.hpp file. 

The first algorithm was the alternate algorithm, in the first step of the algorithm we skipped through the vector by 2 starting from 0 and compared each index to the next one, swapping when necessary. In the next step we did the same except starting from 1. We repeated both of these steps until the vector was sorted correctly.

In the second algorithm, the Lawnmower algorithm, we iterated through the vector starting from 0 by 1 until we reached the end, swapping disks when necessary. Once we got to the end, we iterated from the end of the vector by -1 until we reached the 0th index. We repeated these steps until the disks were sorted.
